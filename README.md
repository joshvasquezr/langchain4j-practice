# LangChain4j Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice files and experimentation with `LangChain4j`. The main goal of this repository is 
to explore and gain a deeper understanding of LangChain concepts and their implementation in Java.

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a personal sandbox for testing, experimenting, and refining LangChain4j concepts. It includes 
sample code, snippets, and implementations of various LangChain4j modules, with the intention of enhancing my familiarity and proficiency with the library.

## What is LangChain4j?
LangChain4j is a Java-based implementation of LangChain, a framework that facilitates the creation of applications 
leveraging large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for building language model applications using Java, focusing 
on ease of use and efficient implementation.
